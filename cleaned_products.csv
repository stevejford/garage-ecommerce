This is a replacement for the low headroom G4 track curve only, if you have an earlier G3 version which is identifiable by the absence of a steel bearing that holds the pole in place then you would need to purchase the G4 Track Curve Kit which comes with a bearing, ramp and longer bolts.

The G3 track curve is no longer available.

##### **Please Note:**   These kits are for local pick-up only.

These brush seal kits are designed to fit around the edges of your door and provide a barrier against ember attack in a bushfire situation.

They have the added advantage of cutting down the amount of dust and leaf debris that can enter the garage as well as cushioning the door to reduce the noise from rattling.

This double door seal kit consists of

4 x 3000mm x 50mm Aluminium Extrusions

4 x 3000mm x 25mm Fire Retardant Brush Seals

This is enough to seal both sides and across the top of the door.

The aluminium extrusion holds the brush at an angle of 55 degrees and is 50mm wide to allow for a variety of fixing options.

| New Security+2.0 remote transmitters operate reliably under all environment conditions and from a greater distance than ever before. Thanks to the latest multi frequency technology the remote will operate even when there is interference from other wireless devices. |
|  |
|  | ![](https://webcdn.chamberlainanz.com/gomerlin/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/08010016/convenient_3.jpg) | **Bright LED Lights** |
| Driving into a dark garage and turning off your headlights can be a very dark experience! 9 Bright LED lights provide energy efficient light that automatically switches on when the door is activated and switches off after 2½ minutes. |
|  |
|  | **Performance** |
|  |
|  | ![](https://webcdn.chamberlainanz.com/gomerlin/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/08025441/performance_1.jpg) | **75% Less Energy** |
| Uses 75% less standby energy. The advanced electronic design in the SilentDrive Pro uses less than 1 watt of electricity when in standby mode, meeting some of the world’s toughest energy saving standards and saving you money. |
|  |
|  | ![](https://webcdn.chamberlainanz.com/gomerlin/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/08025442/performance_2.jpg) | **Quiet and Powerful Motor** |
| SilentDrive Pro’s powerful and fast DC motor is quiet and built to last. It has the strength to open any size of door you have. You don’t have to question SilentDrive Pro, it is the perfect choice! |
|  |
|  | ![](https://webcdn.chamberlainanz.com/gomerlin/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/08025443/performance_3.jpg) | **Improved Remote Range** |
| Tested in side by side comparisons\* the Merlin SilentDrive Pro has up to 18% better range. Which means it is not only more reliable, you can also start opening your garage door sooner.<br>\*Compared to major brands |
|  |
|  | ![](https://webcdn.chamberlainanz.com/gomerlin/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/08025443/performance_4.jpg) | **Adaptive Technology** |
| Automatic power adjustment and electronic mapping of the door means SilentDrive Pro adapts to the change in door spring and hinge operation that naturally occurs with varying weather conditions and age. This technology means less maintenance and trouble free, reliable operation for years to come as the opener adapts to the door every time it is activated. |

|  |
|  | ![](https://webcdn.chamberlainanz.com/gomerlin/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/08010018/secure_1.jpg) | **Security+2.0** |
| Security+2.0 technology inside the remote is designed to communicate on multiple frequencies with the latest Security+2.0 encrypted rolling code. This enhanced radio technology will select the strongest frequency every time, virtually eliminating interference from other devices. It provides the highest level of security available by using a unique code every time the button is pressed. |
|  |
|  | ![ico_3.jpg](https://webcdn.chamberlainanz.com/gomerlin/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/08010018/ico_3.jpg) | **Automatic Close** |
| Forgot to close the door? Don’t worry the timer to close option automatically closes the door. You can set a pre determined time up to 3 minutes. All you have to do to activate this feature is to install the optional safety beams (must be fitted) to ensure safe closing after you have left the garage. |
|  |
|  | ![](https://webcdn.chamberlainanz.com/gomerlin/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/08010018/secure_3.jpg) | **Safety Reversing System** |
| Your safety and property protection is assured because the SilentDrive Pro has automatic safety reversing built in. If the garage door is obstructed while closing, it automatically stops and reverses, if obstructed while opening, it automatically stops. |

We have a full range of garage door springs in Perth catering for all size garage doors.

If you aren’t sure what garage door spring you need, be it a tilt door spring, sectional door spring or roller door spring we are here to help.

Need to buy a replacement spring? Has yours broken? Do you want a DIY fix?

All garage door springs break over time as metal fatigue sets in and getting the right replacement is very important. Getting it wrong can lead to failure of your opener and other components.

How to work out what is the right spring?

We use specialised software and spring calculation charts and can advise on and provide you with the correct unit based on your garage door width, height and weight. You can simply bring into store measurements and maybe even a photo of your garage door, measurements of the spring or the broken one and you can purchase the correct spring.

When working out what the correct spring is we basically need to find out the wire gauge and length of the spring needed.

Common sizes for sectional door springs are 5.6mm x 650mm, 6mm x 760mm, 6.3mm x 760mm and 6.3mm x 970mm . We stock all of these.

We will also need to know whether it’s the left or right hand spring that you need (looking from inside the garage out) or a pair.

We always recommend to replace a pair as they usually break at around the same time as in most cases they are the same age, have done the same work and suffer the same level of metal fatigue. So even if only one is broken out of a pair, chances are the other one is close to breaking point too.

All our parts are tried and tested in the field and we supply to both retail and trade clients.

We offer free expert advice and a huge range of garage door parts.

Call us, see us in store or order online today.

##### **Online ordering notes**

You can add the product to your cart. When going through the cart there is an “order notes” section. Please advise us whether you require a RH spring or a LH spring (Viewed from inside the garage looking out) . If you have ordered 2 springs we will assume it is a pair (1 x LH & 1 x RH) that you require.

LH springs are usually painted red on the end where as RH springs are usually painted black.

[![sectional garage door springs](https://www.ausgaragedoorparts.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/springs.jpg)](https://www.ausgaragedoorparts.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/springs.jpg)

We also need to know what size spring you need. To work this out measure 10 of the coils on the **broken** spring. This will usually be somewhere between 56mm and 63mm. Dividing this by 10 gives us the wire size eg 5.6mm, 6mm, 6.3mm etc

Next measure the total length of the spring.

Your order notes should read something like this

“1 x RH spring, 6mm x 750mm”

Alternatively you can send us measurements of your door and we will work out the correct spring for you.

You can always [contact us](https://www.ausgaragedoorparts.com.au/contact-us/) for help either by phone or email and we will be happy to assist.

##### **Please Note:**   These kits are for local pick-up only.

These brush seal kits are designed to fit around the edges of your door and provide a barrier against ember attack in a bushfire situation.

They have the added advantage of cutting down the amount of dust and leaf debris that can enter the garage as well as cushioning the door to reduce the noise from rattling.

This single door seal kit consists of

3 x 3000mm x 50mm Aluminium Extrusions

3 x 3000mm x 25mm Fire Retardant Brush Seals

This is enough to seal both sides and across the top of the door.

The aluminium extrusion holds the brush at an angle of 55 degrees and is 50mm wide to allow for a variety of fixing options.

The brushes themselves are rated to level UL94 V0 which means that the material will self-extinguish within 10 seconds and may not drip flaming particles.

They are suitable for Bushfire Attack Levels up to BAL40

**It is important to select the correct number hinge** as although they look the same at first glance the hole centers for the roller shaft will change by 5-6mm between each panel so fitting the incorrect hinge will cause your door to bind or scrape along the face.

**When coming into store,** simply bring your broken hinge in or note its position and we will take care of the rest.
